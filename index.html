                Hi! My name is Asher and I am a gardener located in Porland, Oregon.
                If you are looking for someone to maintain your personal garnden then look no further.
                This is a garden that I was hired to maintain and create! I will work ever day to make sure your garden is in tip top
                condition at all times. My goal is to make the garden of your dreams and I will do anything to accomplish it.
                I trim headges, mow lawns, and keep flowers pristine and pretty.
                My normal rate is $15 an hour but terms can be negotiated.
                I currently have a small garden growing near the community center that you can see my work! 
                I have worked with many people around the city and I am hoping to get a store soon.
                I will bring my own equipment so no need to worry if you don't have any.
                If you have any questions or are interested in working with me, inquiry below!

                Credentials: 
                I have a bachelor's degree in forestry and a minor in business. I went to Portland Univeristy and
                I want to make this city look green and great.
